## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design using CSS Grid and custom properties. I also learned how to fetch and dynamically render data from a JSON file using JavaScript and async/await.

### Continued development

I’d like to continue improving how I use JavaScript to structure and render data more efficiently. I also plan to deepen my understanding of container queries and grid layout strategies for responsive designs. 

### Useful resources


- [Josh W. Comeau's Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) — This interactive guide made it easier to understand how CSS Grid works. It helped me visualize layout behavior and confidently apply the right grid properties in my project.

- [Asynchronous JavaScript](https://youtu.be/OFpqvaJ3QYg?si=isNNQlJ4VEMHDu5u) — This video helped me better understand how `async/await` works and how to use it to fetch and display dynamic data.
